# Description

*Cdhist adds 'web-browser like history' to your bash shell.
Every time you change the current directory it records the directory you can go back by simply typing a short command such as '-' or '+', just like clicking web-browsers's 'back' button.
It's more convenient than using directory stacks when you walk around two or three directories.*
